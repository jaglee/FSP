Two U.S. patents have been issued for OCB mode.[5] However, a special exemption has been granted so that OCB mode can be used in software licensed under the GNU General Public License without cost, as well as for any non-commercial, non-governmental application. Since the authors have only applied for patent protection in the U.S., the algorithm is free to use in software not developed and not sold inside the U.S.[6]
As of January 2013, the author has granted a free license for any open source license certified by the Open Source Initiative
