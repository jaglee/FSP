1.Security in mind
 -- header MAC independent of IPv4 address or IPv6 subnet prefix provide inherent mobility and inherent multi-home support
 -- channel binding, with inherent Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) support through GCM-AES
    A SASL-friendly security architecture

2.Inherent mobility support
 -- A reliabe message delivery protocol for mobile agents


3.A new programmer-friendly API set
 -- mordern event-driven asychronous programming interface
 -- simple QoS proposal (FSP over IPv6 only)
 -- integrated name resolution (DNS integration for IPv4/gateway mode for IPv6)


4.Cloud-ready
 -- Support asymmetric transport
    FSP follows Asymmetric Transport Protocol. It is yet another alternative of TCP.
 -- Split of packet layer and message layer
    Virtualization friendly
 -- More than Akamai NetSession Interface
 

5.Low latency and high performance
 -- achieved through connection-reuse (multiplexing and resurrecting)
 -- for host: lead to possibility of millions connection per second
 -- avoid performance degrade due to the uncompetive congestion avoidance policy in the situation of much higher load of video content delivery, yet friendly to ECN (FSP over IPv6 only)
 -- easily to implement direct-data-placement


6.Another IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanism
  FSP over UDP/IPv4 from/to FSP over IPv6 session layer gateway

7.Extensible to reliable multi-cast by utilizing NACK-based retransmission
