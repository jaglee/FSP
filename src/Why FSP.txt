1. Security in mind
 -- header MAC independent of IPv4 address or IPv6 subnet prefix provide inherent mobility and inherent multi-home support
 -- channel binding, with inherent Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) support through GCM-AES
    A SASL-friendly security architecture

2. Inherent mobility support
 -- A reliabe message delivery protocol for mobile agents
 -- Mobile-Cloud-pattern friendly

3. A new programmer-friendly API set
 -- mordern event-driven asychronous programming interface
 -- easy-to-use transmit transaction concept
 -- easy-to-use transport layer encryption
 -- integrated name resolution (gateway mode for IPv6)

4. Favoring performant web-applications
 -- fast clone/multiplication of connections, save round-trips
 -- transmit transaction saves application acknowledgement

5. Another IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanism
  -- FSP over UDP/IPv4 is NAT-friendly
  -- transport/session layer gateway of FSP over UDP/IPv4 from/to FSP over IPv6
